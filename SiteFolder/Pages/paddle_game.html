<h1>Paddle Game using AI</h1>
<p>Just made a simple game using vanilla html and javascript, using grok3.</p>
<video src="SiteFolder\Images\paddle-game\paddle-game.mp4" controls autoplay muted width="100%" height="600"></video>
<p>The game works in both PC and mobile in any internet browser</p>
<a href="https://gametesis.github.io/paddle-game/">Play Game</a>
<p>If you want to have the app of the game go here:</p>
<a href="https://gametesis.github.io/paddle-game/app-debug.apk">Download apk</a>
<p>The trick to make the app was just using WebViewScreen creating the app</p>
<p>So that the android simulates a browser in the app an runs the game in it!</p>
