<h1>Purpose Calendar Manager Description:</h1>
<p>To start explaining this project first it is required to define what is a purpose calendar. Purpose Calendar was inspired by this project:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar" target="_blank" style="font-size: 1.7em;">Inspiration Project Link</a></div>
<p>Basically is the same thing but in digital format. If a person has a goal that wants to accomplish this year, and wants to keep track of how he/she is doing, then a purpose calendar helps you with that. A purpose calendar manager is basically a manager for many purpose calendars. Below there is a link with the browser application, the source code and a video tutorial.</p>
