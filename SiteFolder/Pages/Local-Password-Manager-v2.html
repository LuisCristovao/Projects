<ol>
<li>Manage passwords in a secure way</li>
<li>Be accessible everywhere (pc and phone)</li>
<li>Sync information between devices safely</li>
<li>No installation required</li>

<h2 id="manage-passwords-in-a-secure-way">Manage passwords in a secure way</h2>
<p>I use a simple script that encrypts data supposedly with AES256 encryption.</p>
<p>check the autor of the script below:</p>

    <p>I look at the script and it seemed safe and simple and did its job so I used it.</p>

<h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3>
<p>Maybe use PGP encryption in the future or an updated encryption script</p>
<h2 id="be-accessible-everywhere-pc-and-phone--no-installation-required">Be accessible everywhere (pc and phone) / No installation required</h2>
<p>This point was essential for me because most password managers out there need some kind of installation (app or windows install) and some only work on PC, others are not free…</p>
<p>So what I wanted to do was a browser application that worked both on mobile and pc (actually any device with a browser) and it is free and does not need installation because works on a browser.</p>
<h3 id="improvements-1">improvements</h3>
<p>Update cache management to update the program when I make a git push.</p>
<h2 id="sync-information-between-devices-safely">Sync information between devices safely</h2>
<p>One crucial feature to make this software usable is data synchronization across devices.</p>
<p>Nowadays this is possible through an external server and secret key</p>
<p>but in the future, I hope to make this data synchronization via peer-to-peer software like webRTC. Note here, data is always encrypted when is exchanged, of course!</p>
<h3 id="improvements-2">Improvements</h3>
<p>sync using peer-to-peer webRTC instead of an external server.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
     It is an improvement to the project local password manager server <a href="https://github.com/LuisCristovao/Local_Password_Manager_Server">Here</a><div class="">
