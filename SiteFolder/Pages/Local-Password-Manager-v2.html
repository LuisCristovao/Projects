<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Program to manage passwords in a safe way. It is an improvement to the project local password manager server <a href="https://github.com/LuisCristovao/Local_Password_Manager_Server">Here</a><div class=""></div>
</p>
<p>
    The security failure of the previous version was that it was built to work offline. You could work online, but inside some networks, it was possible to get inside someone's passwords by knowing the IP address and by knowing when the user already inserted the password successfully. To avoid this attack a person must enter the network with Public Network Profile, meaning: your PC is hidden from other devices from the network.  The problem was if the router was not good it would allow potential hackers to discover other PCs anyway.

    Finally, the main improvements are completely local, no one can access because it is not a server just simple HTML and javascript all of it. It works on the phone!
