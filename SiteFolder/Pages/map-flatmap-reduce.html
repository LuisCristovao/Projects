<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>To test the following examples simply press  the <b>F12</b> button on chrome or firefox browser to open the console. There it is possible to write and execute javascript code.</p>
<h2>ForEach</h2>
<p>If you don't know anything about it, here it is a little explanation. Imagine you have the following function: </p>
<xmp>
function foreach(some_array,some_function_action){
    for (i=0;i<some_array.length;i++){
          var element=some_array[i]
          some_function_action(element)    
    }
}
</xmp>
<p>This function receives an array and a function as input. The input function will receive each element of the array and do something with it.
This function is essentially what foreach function does.</p>
<p>Let us see in action:</p>
<xmp>
var arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
foreach(arr,(element)=>{console.log(`Number: ${element}`)})
//This will print all numbers of array like this:
//Number: 1
//Number: 2
//Number: 3
// ...
//Try the code in the console just by copy and paste there and press enter button
</xmp>
