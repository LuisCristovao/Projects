<h1>File Upload Server Description:</h1>

<p> This project, as the title says is server that allows a user to upload files and store them. This project was made in <b>Bottle: Python Web Framework</b>, meaning in Python. There is a live demo of this project on heroku but as I am using the free server heroku gives to users, when the server is not used for a long period of time, it restarts the server <b>Deleting all Files Uploaded!</b> So it is possible to use this as a upload server for a short amount of time. </p>
<p>Below there is a <b>live demo, The Source Code actually running in Heroku app</b> and a small video tutorial how to use the application server.</p>
