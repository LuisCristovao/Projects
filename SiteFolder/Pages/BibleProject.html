<h1>Bible Project</h1>

<a href="https://luiscristovao.github.io/Bible-Search/">App Site</a>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to copy the already existing  <a href="https://www.bibliaonline.com.br/">bible browser app.</a></p>

<p>I wanted to do this because I did not like the search engine of the site and it lack a favorite verse feature.</p>

<p>After creating this project I notice that after all their search engine and product overall are actually very good :)</p>

<p>But the favorite verse feature is still lacking so I will try to do it in the future.</p>
