<h1>Bible Project</h1>
<h2>App and Code</h2>
<a href="https://luiscristovao.github.io/Bible-Search/">App Site</a>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to copy the already existing  <a href="https://www.bibliaonline.com.br/">bible browser app.</a></p>

<p>I wanted to do this because I did not like the search engine of the site and it lack a favorite verse feature.</p>

<p>After creating this project I notice that after all their search engine and product overall are actually very good :)</p>

<p>I will try to make this project evolve with time.</p>

<p>Some features I wish <a href="https://www.bibliaonline.com.br/">bible app.</a> had I created in my own app, such as:</p>
<ul style="font-size:1.5em">
    <li>Dark Mode</li>
    <li>Bionic Reading</li>
    <li>Favorites section</li>
</ul>
