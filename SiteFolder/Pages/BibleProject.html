<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is trying to copy and add some features to an already existing  bible app<a href="https://www.bibliaonline.com.br/">bible browser app.</a></p>

<p>My motivation to do this, was because there were some features I would like the previous app to have and it didn't so I made my own to my liking</p>

<p>After creating this project I notice that after all their search engine and product overall are actually very good :)</p>

<p>I will try to make this project evolve with time.</p>

<p>Some simple features I wished the previously mentioned app had are the following:</p>
<ul style="font-size:1.5em">
    <li>Better search engine</li>
    <li>Dark mode</li>
    <li>Favorites section</li>
    <li>Synchronization between computers of favorite sction</li>
    <li>Bionic reading</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a still in development project.</p>
