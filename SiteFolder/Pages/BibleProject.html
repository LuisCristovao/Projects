<h1>Bible Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of this project is to replicate and enhance some features of an existing Bible app: 
  <a href="https://www.bibliaonline.com.br/">Bible Browser App</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I decided to build my own version because I thought it would be a fun project, and there were features I wanted to add 
  that I found relatively easy to implement.
</p>

<p>
  After working on this project, I realized that their search engine and overall product are actually very good :)
</p>

<p>
  I plan to continue improving this project over time.
</p>

<p>These are a few simple features I felt were missing from the previously mentioned app:</p>

<ul style="font-size:1.5em">
  <li>Improved search engine</li>
  <li>Dark mode</li>
  <li>Favorites section</li>
  <li>Synchronization of favorites across devices</li>
  <li>
    Bionic reading

  </li>
</ul>
