<h1>Local Multiplayer Pong Game</h1>
<p>
    I created a classic Pong game with local multiplayer using WebRTC favorite library, PeerJS. 
    Feel free to try the game yourself and play with a friend!

<h2 style="margin: 20px;">Developer Notes:</h2>
<ul style="font-size: larger;">
    <li>The main game loop was created with the help of AI (Grok3), so there were no major issues here.</li>
    <li>The multiplayer part, however, was not implemented as I intended, so I had to assist the AI:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>I used another project, where I built a chat application using PeerJS, as a template for this project.</li>
        <li>Basically, if both players are on the same network, PeerJS only needs a connection string 
            to establish the connection between them.</li>
        <li>One issue to consider is implementing multiple connection attempts in case of failure.</li>
        <li>
            Another challenge was determining when the connection was successfully established 
            and preventing PeerJS from initiating additional connections with other players afterward.
        </li>
        <li>Fixing game bugs, such as an issue where the game speed was increasing exponentially.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Although the game runs well for the non-host player when there is a good connection, 
        some lag is inevitable. However, it is still playable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unfortunately, while PeerJS is a great tool, achieving smooth performance requires 
        further optimizations.
    </li>
</ul>
