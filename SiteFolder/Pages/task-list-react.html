<h1>Task List React App</h1>

<p>I created this small <b>task list</b> application as a fun way to learn <b>React</b>.</p>
<p>
  The app is built with <b>React, TypeScript, and Vite</b>. It uses <b>LocalStorage</b> to
  persist tasks in the browser.
</p>
<p>You can drag tasks to <b>reorder</b> them, as well as <b>edit</b> or <b>delete</b> them.</p>
<p>It also works on <b>mobile devices</b>, with all the <b>same features</b> available.</p>
