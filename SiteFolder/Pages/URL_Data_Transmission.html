<h1>URL Data Transmission Project</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of this project is to share information with anyone through an url.
    As the URL is limited in size, I need to compress the information the best  way as possible.
    To do the compression I used the lib <a href="https://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html">lz-string</a>.
    Below I share the links for the html page and the source code.
