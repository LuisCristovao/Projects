<h1>Basic ML Server Description:</h1>

<p> This project, as the title says is a basic machine learning server that allows the user to export the model in the end from the train dataset.
    The server will accept <b>csv like files</b>, for instance a <b>.txt</b> with the features separeted by a <b>" , "</b> or any othe character. The target class must be in the <b>last right column</b> in order to work!! Also I made this server using <b>Bottle: Python Web Framework</b>
</p>

<p>Below there is a <b>live demo, The Source Code actually running in Heroku app</b> and a small video tutorial how to use the application server.</p>
<p>The <b>live demo</b>  unfortunately does <b>not work</b> anymore, due to heroku server not <b>being free</b></p>
